# Nagata's criterion

Let R be an integral domain satisfying ACC on divisibility, and
let p be a prime element such that R[p^{-1}] is a UFD. Then R
is a UFD. The proof uses Kaplansky's theorem: every nonzero
prime ideal of R contains a prime element, obtained by lifting
a prime from the localisation and cancelling powers of p.
